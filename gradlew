# We are going to use the Java exec form and give it a single argument, the
# command line. This is for two reasons:
#
# 1. This is much simpler.
# 2. If we tried to build up an array of arguments, we would have problems
#    with spaces in arguments.
#
# This is not a problem when using the Groovy script. This is only a problem
# when using the shell script.
#
# We have to escape the double quotes in the arguments.
#

# Java process. The Java process is then passed to the operating system,
# which is then passed to the shell.

# does not interpret them.
#
# The arguments are passed to the Java process as a single string.
